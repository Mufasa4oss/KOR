üß± GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT ‚Äì ECONOMIC/STRATEGY SIM

Added gameContext class for the easier passing of vital game objects 7-21



Game design is a game where the player controls a country primarily via it government system they implement policy and or laws to govern and encourage certain outcomes such as economic development. One potential flaw is that this concept is very complicated and needs to be well designed it isn't as simple as player places factory, -> factory produces good.



TODO:





the player can submit policy as the government to encourage companies of a particular type.



1st: scatter resources on the map according to some logic - done

2nd: if resource type exist then company type gets created 

3rd: country naming generator

4th - images for resources. What is the best source or AI art generator for 64x64





You don‚Äôt need the final vision right now. You just need a vertical slice of mechanics that create:



1. Choice



2\. Consequence



3\. Feedback



Example ‚Äì First Gameplay Loop:

‚ÄúPlayer selects one of 3 government policies (Subsidies, Tariffs, Tax Cuts). Each affects company growth rate in the country differently. After 3 turns, they get feedback: company count changed, revenue changed, approval changed.‚Äù



This is tiny, but it creates a full loop:



Player acts



Game responds



Player evaluates



Repeat



Once that works, you can expand the systems below it (population, logistics, markets) to enrich the loop rather than replacing it.
